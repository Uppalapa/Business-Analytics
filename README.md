## Project Summary
Health in Hands is a platform which would eradicate the problems of missing medical reports for the patients by providing them an online portal where they can manage their reports. It would also help them to schedule an appointment with the required doctor/diagnostic center as per their convenience.

## Problem
* Missing medical records
* Small clinics/hospitals do not maintain patientâ€™s records
* Wait time in the hospitals/clinics for consultation
* Difficulty in finding the best suited doctor
* We go through some of the tests that we do not need only because of missing reports
