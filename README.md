1. Business Case
1.1 Executive Summary
Health in Hands is a platform which would eradicate the problems of missing medical reports for the patients by providing them an online portal where they can manage their reports. It would also help them to schedule an appointment with the required doctor/diagnostic center as per their convenience.
1.1.1 Issue
India is a vast country with the second highest population in the world. The medical community of India faces a problem of the patient’s reports. Most of the patients lose their medical records due to ignorance and many of the patients go to small medical facilities (small clinics in small towns and villages) where their records are not preserved. The main problem patients’ face is that they do not have their medical records when they need them the most and the doctors have to diagnose patient from the beginning every time they come for treatment.
1.1.2 Anticipated Outcomes
Health in Hands is a project that aims to minimize this gap of missing patients’ reports. The medical community of India IMA (Indian Medical Association) needs a product that would be easy to use and help patient’s store their medical records so that they would have an easy access to them all the time so that the doctors could treat patients in a more efficient way and patient’s would also save money in tests they don’t need to go through with.
1.1.3 Recommendation
Health in Hands aims to provide a medium for the patients to store their medical reports after each treatment safely in their online account and it would allow the diagnostic center an easy access to upload new reports for the patients. It would also allow patients to book an appointment with doctors online to save their time in the waiting area and doctors an authority to manage their appointment calendar.
1.1.4 Justification
Many patients in India do not preserve their medical reports and other relevant documents. This creates a problem when they visit a doctor for any consultation as the doctor has to examine the patient for all possible disease with which the patient might suffer. Having their records with them will help the
5
5 Health in Hands
doctors to eliminate a few diseases there by saving the patient’s money and time by eliminating some unnecessary tests. The proposed solution would help the patient’s to store their medical records in an online portal that would be available to them. As currently, the patient’s keep a hard copy on their records which usually they lose.
Moreover, Health in Hands would also allow the doctors to manage their appointment calendar and patient’s to book an appointment with doctors and diagnostic centers as per their convenience so that the patient would not have to sit in the waiting area for long time to get their turn. Presently, most of the patients go to see the doctor without booking an appointment and they have to sit in the waiting area and wait for hours for their turn and sometimes they arrive at the clinic and find out that the doctor is not present on that day.
By implementing the proposed solution, the patient’s as well as the doctor’s will both benefit as they would have less tests to go through with and when the patient comes for counseling with all the reports, doctors would be able to treat them better.

1.3 Problem Definition
1.3.1 Problem Statement
India is a vast country and with world’s second largest population the medical community is finding it difficult to store the patient’s information so that it would be easily accessible by the patient. Also, the patient lose their hard copy of medical document and when they go to a doctor for consulting they often don’t have the relevant document that would help the doctor to filter out some of the cases.
In addition to that, every time a patient visits a doctor for any consultation they have to sit in the waiting area for a long time and wait for their turn and sometimes when they arrive at the clinic only to find out that the doctor is not available on that day.
1.3.2 Organizational Impact
The solution being derived will have a significant impact on the stakeholders as it aims to help the patients with record keeping. Below is the detailed analysis:
Tool: The patients could download the mobile application or access the web portal that would help them to store the medical records as well as help them to view the doctor’s schedule to book an appointment on the go for any consultation. The doctors would have authority to manage their calendar.
Process: The application would ease the process for the doctor to examine a patient as the patient will have access to all their records. It would also ease the process of booking an appointment for the patient as per their convenience.
Hardware/Software: The doctors and patients would be able to download the software on their smart phones from the respective application store or they can access the web portal to perform any action.
Roles and Responsibilities: The application would be managed by a group of people to maintain and support the application while being in contact with the government and the IMA for any requirement updates.
1.3.3 Technology Migration
The application will provide a new mobile based platform. The following is the overview of this approach.
 Phase I: Hardware/Software will be purchased and the systems will be created in the mobile-based environment and tested by the IT development group.
 Phase II: This will be used as a backup system and to archive all data.
7
7 Health in Hands
 Phase III: The web-based platform will be populated with all the patient’s and their medical records, and doctor’s info.
 Phase IV: The mobile-based platform will go live and all patients and doctors will receive access on the mobile-based platform.
1.4 Project Overview
Health in Hands will provide a platform for patients to store their medical information as well as reports from time to time and they will have access to it through the online web as well as the mobile application. Additionally, it will help them setup an appointment with the doctors as well as the diagnostic centers as per their availability and convenience.
1.4.1 Project Description
Health in Hands will provide a platform for the patients to store their lab reports as well as relevant documents like prescriptions, immunization forms, and scanned reports. It will allow them to access their documents whenever they need it with the help of a mobile-based application or through a web portal. It will also ease the process of booking an appointment with a doctor for consultation.
The diagnostic center would also have similar portal that would help them to upload the patient’s medical reports to the patient’s profile with the consent of the respective patient. Moreover, it will also provide a service to the doctors and the diagnostic centers to manage their appointment calendar so that the patient could book it as per their convenience. Patients receive appointment cancellation notification if the doctor cancels their appointment.
The application will be developed by the company and they would be responsible for maintaining it. The government and the IMA would make amends to their requirements for the application if needed. This application would go through the complete SDLC & STLC cycles before it is released to the audience.
1.4.2 Goals and Objectives
Health in Hands project supports several functionalities to support the patient’s as well as doctors functionalities to streamline the consultancy process.
